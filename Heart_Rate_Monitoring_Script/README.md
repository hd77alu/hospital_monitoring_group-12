# - 'count' stores how many readings we've processed.
# - 'max_heart_rate' will store the highest heart rate we've encountered.
# - 'min_heart_rate' is initially set to a very high number so that any real value will be lower.

# We then read the log file line by line.
# For each line, we extract the heart rate (we're assuming it's the 12th column in the file).
# The heart rate is added to the 'total_heart_rate', and we increase the count of readings.

# Task 2

# First, we created a new directory called "archive" to store our logs.

# The '-p' flag ensures the directory is only created if it doesn't already exist.

mkdir -p archive

# Next, we moved the heart_rate_log.txt file into the "archive" directory.

# We renamed the file to include the current timestamp in the format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.

mv heart_rate_log.txt archive/heart_rate_log_$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S").txt

# Now, we made all the shell script files in this directory executable so they can be run.
chmod +x *.sh

# We then executed the heart rate monitor script to start tracking heart rate data.
./heart_rate_monitor.sh

# To watch the recorded heart rate data in real-time, we used 'tail' on the log file.
# We exited the real-time view by pressing 'CTRL + Z'.

tail -f heart_rate_log.txt  # Exit with CTRL + Z

# Finally, we ran the 'archive_log.sh' script to archive the log files.
./archive_log.sh

# At this point, the log file has been moved to the "archive" directory, and it now includes a timestamp in its name.



# Task 3

#!/bin/bash  # It tells the system which interpreter to use to run the script.

# Define variables

# We created variables that will store values used throughout the script.

# - 'group_number' stores the assigned group number.

# - 'archive_dir' stores the name of the directory for archived logs, incorporating the group number dynamically.

# - 'host' is the remote server hostname or IP address.

# - 'username' is the username for accessing the remote server.

# - 'remote_dir' is the destination directory on the remote server where the files will be backed up.

group_number=12
archive_dir="archived_logs_group$group_number"
host="fdb056dd42a9.6b7419f6.alu-cod.online"
username="fdb056dd42a9"
remote_dir="/home/"

# Create the archive directory if it doesn't exist
# The 'mkdir -p' command is used to create the directory specified by 'archive_dir'.
# The '-p' option ensures that no error is thrown if the directory already exists.
mkdir -p $archive_dir

# Move archived log files
# The 'mv' command moves all log files with the naming pattern 'heart_rate_log.txt_*' 
# into the directory specified by 'archive_dir'. This helps organize archived logs in a single place.

mv heart_rate_log.txt_* $archive_dir/
echo "Moved archived logs to $archive_dir."

# Backup to remote server

# The 'scp -r' command securely copies the entire contents of 'archive_dir' to a remote server.

# '-r' ensures that the entire directory is copied recursively.

# The connection uses SSH for secure file transfer, and files are placed into the 'remote_dir' on the remote server.

scp -r $archive_dir/* $username@$host:$remote_dir
echo "Backup to remote server completed."
